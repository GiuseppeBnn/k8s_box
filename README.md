## Welcome to K8S_box

With K8s_box you can create real Kubernetes deployments on a cluster of several machines or on a single node through tools like MicroK8s or Minikube. In particular, it allows you to deploy containers by simplifying and hiding the complexity of the Kubernetes structure in favor of a language similar to the one used in docker compose.

it is very simple to use if you already know the world of docker compose and will allow you to test your projects if you have a series of low spec pcs.

This project uses Helm templates. In the /k8s_box_templates folder you will find several examples and guides including: a step-by-step guide to learn the syntax and create your first hello-world cluster, a more complex example with several containers of a project adapted from compose (complete-working-example- ...) and the boilerplate template which is the basis of the whole thing.

This project is pretty new so if you find errors or have suggestion please don't hesitate to contact me or propose a solution.
